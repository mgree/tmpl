# Fathom

Fathom is a package that streamlines Tmpl topic modeling. It takes care of all of the heavy lifting involved with preprocessing Tmpl corpora,
storing important data throughout a topic model training run, and curating the output
of the models to be ready-to-use and easy to evaluate and perform analysis on right after training.

It uses a pair of Scikit-learn's pre-built models -- LatentDirichletAllocation and NMF --
to build and train topic models at its core.

Note that this is the second iteration of the Tmpl topic modeling suite.

## Getting Started

Let's walk through how to get started developing and training Tmpl topic models using Fathom.
There will be various asides and explanations sprinkled throughout this to help familiarize you
with working with the various features and aspects of Fathom (eg. there will be various notes on
Python packages).

### Installing

#### Cloning the repository

First, clone this repository! Run this command in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/mgree/tmpl.git

#### Setting up a virtual environment
Now we'll set up a virtual environment to install Fathom in and develop and train models in. A virtual environment
gives you a dedicated space where you can install any sort of dependencies you need without messing with
your global dependencies. Moreover, since Fathom is built in Python 2.7, the virtual environment will ensure
that we are using Python 2.7 and that all of the dependencies we install are in version compatible with Python 2.7.
You can read more about Python virtual environments here: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/

First, make sure that you have `pip` installed. `pip` is the Python package manager that makes it easy
to install Python packages. Run the following:

    which pip

If you have `pip`, you will see the path of the executable where it lives. If not, you won't see anything and
you should follow the steps here to install `pip`: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Now, install the Python package `virtualenv` used to create and manage virtual environments:

    pip install virtualenv

With that installed, created a new virtual environment (where you want in your filesystem):

    virtualenv tmpl_venv

Feel free to replace `tmpl_venv` with whatever name you want.

Navigate to your new virtual environment's directory (in the above case, `cd tmpl_venv`) and use the following
to activate your environment:

    source bin/activate

You can now install Python packages and develop in your new isolated virtual environment. That is, if you install
any Python packages in it while its activated, they will only be accessible while its activated.

To deactivate your virtual environment, use the `deactivate` command.

#### Installing Fathom in your virtual environment
Next, make sure you're in the `fathom/` directory:

    cd fathom

You should now see a file named `setup.py`. This is the setup script for the Python package. All
Python packages have one of these -- they help make sure all the necessary dependency packages are installed
and that the package is made available to be imported into other Python programs that you may create.

Run the following command to install the Fathom Python package:

    python setup.py install

If for some reason this fails, you can manually install the dependencies with the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If everything goes right (and I really hope it did), Fathom should be installed and ready to use!

### Running your first pipeline

The main entry point for using Fathom is `main.py` located at `fathom/fathom/main.py`:

To train a pipeline, you must specify the local directory path where the Tmpl corpora of interest is saved.
The following command will kick of a pipeline with the default parameters:

    python main.py /Users/smacpher/clones/tmpl_venv/tmpl-corpus/proceedings

This run will be have three main steps: 1) parse the raw XML proceeding files (one per conference and year),
2) read the parsed corpus into the topic model and store relevant data (papers, conferences, authors, etc.) into
a TmplDB instance along the way, and 3) train a topic model over the corpus which when finished, will produce an
output directory of the form `models/<model_unique_name>` where `<model_unique_name>` will look something like
`mf_tfidfv_20n_1000f_200i_2018-05-15T20:43:51.844410`.

There is one output directory per model and it contains three
output files: 1) `model.pkl`, the pickled TopicModel object (to save its exact state, attributes, and the trained
Scikit-learn model to make future inferences should we need to), 2) `db.sqlite3`, the Sqlite3 database produced by
the TmplDB module that stores the scores (topic vectors) of all of the papers in the corpus and relevant metadata
about the corpus (see `fathom/fathom/schemas/init.sql` for the full database schema), and 3) `summary.txt`, a
human-readable text file summarizing the results of the topic model (top 10 words and top 10 papers per topic).

## Known features yet to be added
1) Adding tfidf support for LDA topic models. I never got arround to adding
support for using the tfidf vectorizer for LDA topic models. Currently, you
can only use the tfidif vectorizer with NMF topic models and have to stick to
using the basic count vectorizer with LDA.

2) Automatically generating metric views. Professor Greenberg walked me through
a couple of interesting distance metrics for researchers during the last
couple weeks of the semester. I think a good next feature would be to either
add another pipeline for generating those metrics off of an existing tmpl run
or automatically generating those views as the last step in a tmpl run.
