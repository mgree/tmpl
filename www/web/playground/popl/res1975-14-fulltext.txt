programming languages natural languages and mathematics by peter copenhagen university abstract some aspects of programming are through with similar aspects of mathematics and natural lan guages the split between pure and applied mathematics is found similarly in programming the development of natural languages toward based language types for programming language design based on general abstract constructs by analogy with of the history of artificial auxiliary languages it is suggested that and cobol will remain for a long time to come the most promising for further work of wide influence is seen to be high quality program literature ie programs of general utility and studies of questions related to program style introduction programming has many points in com with both mathematics and natural languages in these notes i shall not try to cover all of these but i shall be particularly concerned with these fields as they exist and are used by groups of people perhaps a reasonably accurate description of my main topic can we learn about programming languages from the aspects of mathematics and natural languages now why is this a relevant topic to consider well i definitely feel that there is something in the of programming there is a lot of discussion but i think that most of it misses the point there are too many too many quick tions a too wide gap between theory and practice i feel that we need to take but before doing so we need to our this is where ma and natural languages come in they are our among the disciplines but as a major point of difference they are old they have in this world for so long that they provide a long series of cases of con with people with society cases that we might learn something from this obviously is a if it is to be done far beyond what i am capable of carrying through what i can do at present is no more than discuss a series of points that i have noted over the last many years and that i have found i to no more than that in particular i use a number of sources as i have found them i will give you the to them but whether they have been or found wrong by later i do not always know for sure so i hope to your but i will not that i have found the answers pure applied mathematics think have now to start with mathematics i it is proper to say at once that i never been a or even r address to become one early in my life i was by which my chosen field for many years i quickly realized that to go in this field i had to know some mathematics which i then to study but mathematics to me at all times a tool not something of primary interest with this point of it will not be too surprising that i look upon much of the mathematical activity with as to its importance i certainly cannot view mathematics as an ideal that should a on the other hand i do see a great similarity between mathematics and programming first and because they both are tools for a wide variety of other disciplines so this is the point i want to consider the relation to the disciplines that use mathematics as a tool for many years there has been an ac distinction between pure and applied mathematics this seems to the relation to applications in a clear and simple manner the point i want to make is that this is by no means as sim ple as it looks form outside if we try to this matter we may the of the themselves this may reveal some real of view at one end of the we may find g h one of the leading of his in his a pure he presents the view who will of a his chosen field to the point of i have never done anything useful no discovery of has made or is likely to make directly or indirectly for good or ill the least difference to the of the world a like a or a is a of patterns the or the patterns like the must be the ideas like the or the words must fit together in a way is the first test there is no place in the world for tics very little of mathematics is useful practically and that little is how view is among i dont know for sure there are however other views john von in an article lhe expresses a rather view the most characteristic fact about mathematics is in my its quite relationship to the natural sciences or more generally to any science which on a higher than purely tive level most people and others will agree that mathematics is not an empirical science or at least that it is in a manner which differs in several respects from the techniques of the empirical sciences and yet its development is very closely linked with the natural sciences one of its main branches geometry actually started as a natural empirical science some of the best of modern mathematics i believe the best ones clearly in the natural sciences there is a quite in the nature of mathematics one has to realize this to accept it and to it into ones on the subject this double face is the face of mathematics so much for john von the question is than these tw indicate however in in an article the in mathematics stated on the one hand while several important changes have taken place since in our tion of mathematics or in our points of view concerning it the one which involves a in ideas is the discovery that mathematics is en independent of the physical world when we stop to compare the mathematics of with mathematics as it was at the close of the we may well be to note how our mathematical knowledge has in and in complexity but we should also not fail to observe how closely this has been involved with an em upon abstraction and an concern with the and analysis of broad mathematical patterns indeed upon closer we see that this new made ble only by the of mathematics from its applications has been the true source of its and growth during the present on the other hand later in the same ar when discussing applications of mathematics we find for it is only to the extent that ma is from the which have attached it in the past to particular aspects of that it can become the extremely flexible and powerful we need to break paths into areas now beyond our thus we have here a claim that precisely in being pure mathematics will best serve the applications statements soon met in a discussion in november richard makes article his point of saying as a sweeping claim as an at to a line for research and before all for the ar seems a signal and in need of the of is by the fact that this fashion does not at all non sense but merely a half truth half must not be to sweep aside the aspects of the balanced whole truth certainly ma thought operates by tion yet the life of our science through its roots these roots reach down in tion deep into what might be called abstraction and generalization is not more for mathematics than of and before all not more than inductive intuition we must not accept the old that the cation of mathematical science is the of the human mind mathematics must not be allowed to split and to di toward a and an applied variety it must remain and be as a unified strand in the broad stream of science and must be pre from a little side that might in the the divergent are in mathematics and yet prove an sent to this it may be added that the split between the pure and applied is fairly new up to and including the time of who from to the were active in both tions he split may have something to do with the specialization that a when the field too for any individual to it all another likely is the modern type of university indeed pure tics with its scope for the ation of conceptual structures of table coherence but practical is a perfect field of study for a academic however again this split becomes a problem only when the idea starts to that one kind of mathematics is to the other to say that is where we are now do these problems and carry over the field of as far as i can see to a considerable extent von double face of ma has a direct analogy in pro gramming on the where we have the one hand programming as an challenge e w dijkstra of in or as a field for never ending re of programming language and on the other hand programming applied to a wide range of practical prob by of programmers and the split described by is clearly there with us the second software engineering conference found this to be the core question accepting then that the analogy be mathematics and programming on this issue what may we learn is valid from ma the obvious is that the deep gap between theory and practice in programming may for long without anything much being done about it the by of ma a little side that might in the has not so far turned out to be real it was up by as a that might make people work more on removing the split of mathematics but as far as i know it has had little or no effect i see no reason why programming should differently already we have an established pattern on the one side the in computer science projects of a highly na ture in only very slight with the activity of the other side the com producing amounts of programming that to the university people are very i see no reason why this pattern will not whether we like it or not programming languages and natural languages let me now turn to my second field of natural language at this point of transition i cannot help expres a of at the use of the word language in the context pro gramming language i definitely feel that if taken this of expression is as a first step to our of at this of the term perhaps we can ourselves that and used the word for specialized notations long before we did already in the and perhaps even before however i feel to the relation further thus although i find several that are i do not wish to the differences of characteristics and use between natural and programming languages among such i would like to mention natural languages are used mostly in form in capabilities in hand language they ly what they need from a highly complex stream of they are to making use of the interactive of in up what they have not understood by contrast programming is done mostly in writing and in terms of a slow and interaction with a computer this difference in mode of use certainly must be taken into account if we try to transfer ence from the field of natural language into programming most of what is said in natural languages is intended and understood only in a way the reaction to some not very precisely defined of the world this normal use of language is far away from its use for example in science to state clearly defined facts and relations by contrast anything ex in a programming language is in to be understood and interpreted by a computer in a well defined way this difference between natural lan guage and programming cannot be aside by that the lack of precision of natural language is a that can and should be removed on the contrary it seems quite possible that this lack of precision is to the ability of natural language to develop and make it possible to of a never ending series of ever new ideas from this point of view every programming language is just another example of the ability of natural language to extend itself to cover new ground thus there is no deep analogy be a natural language and a programming language rather there is a relation of everything that can be ex in a programming language can be expressed equivalently although perhaps in a host natural language while the converse is false a natural language an extensible universe of that allows new notations such as programming languages to be added at will with this against con behind me i shall now get down to the that i still find between natural language and programming languages is al ready an old just think of three types of language however the that i shall have not much attention before as far as i know many of them will be derived from the work of the great whose works on the language and its grammar con to be used is for many years i have found a rich source of he took a very broad view of his chosen field and combined this with a for during his early he a of a reaction against an earlier school of who on an in the classical languages above all from his work around maintained the of modern languages with and at the top of his scale at this time he was also very active in the field of as one outcome of his interest he very to the writing of of for use in in his later years his major con was a modern grammar in this did not prevent from also taking active part in the work on establishing an artificial language several of these fields of activity offer interesting in the present context language quality the of the quality of a na language is treated at length by more specifically he is concerned with development the development that natural languages have should be regarded as progress or pp first about this question in at a time when was dominated by an interest in and for classical and the of this period is described thus by to fresh from the ordinary grammar school training no language would seem really that had not four or five distinct cases and three or had less than five and as many in its accordingly such languages as had either lost much of their original in forms eg or or had never had any so far as one eg were naturally upon with something of the on in reduced or the for this first as being and in sup port from instances collected ly second as being as to the method by which value is to be measured by what standard and what tests the of languages or of forms are to be as he then goes on to describe his own what is to be taken into account is of course the of the speaking community and if we consistently con language as a set of human actions with a definite end in view namely the communications of and then it becomes easy to find tests by which to measure values for from that point of view it is evident that that language which goes in the art of much with little means or in other words which is able to express the greatest amount of meaning with the simplest mechanism at this point discusses an to this based on a claim that handle their language without the least or effort on the basis of several kinds of observations he concludes to my mind there is not the that different languages differ very much in even to native now sets out to consider the development of natural languages and in particular to find out whether this development may be regarded as one of progress or if measured along his chosen scale of values his conclusion is as follows the sum total of changes when we compare a remote period the present time shows a over with of or in different changes this conclusion follows upon a dis that summarizes in points these points where modern manifest their over language forms with a few examples added for illustration are the forms are generally thus involving less and requiring less time for their examples old il a had a global the of st matthew contains in about in in there are not so many forms to burden the memory example and further forms are all in by had the formation of word forms is much more regular their syntactic use presents few er character more analytic and abstract expression by ring possible a great many and which were ble or example in there is no difficulty du in saying this causes ble in languages with even in either you or i are wrong either you or i am wrong are both incorrect either you are wrong or i is and the known un der the name of have become super example in opera number is expressed four times case also four times and twice in the corresponding all good old each idea is expressed once only a clear and unambiguous under is through a regular word order example john and have two different clear meanings in two further ar of the same three words have new clear meanings john the of these results to programming appears to me to be the in which they reveal what is in a deep sense a natural form of expression for human after all these reflect of of over they may well be taken in as in designing pro gramming languages they support the idea that programming languages should be built from a few very general very abstract concepts that can be ed in many combinations thereby yielding the desired flexibility of expression they provide an argument against program ring languages that include many special features with limited fields of tion and that include many cases in their definition point concerning freedom of com of the language elements would seem to support a freedom from for example type restrictions it might per support the taken in pl where as far as possible every of operands and operators has a meaning in to the for example algol and where type make many combinations illegal however in this point the difference between a language for easy interactive use and one for communication should perhaps be considered the point may be made that the of due to a that is introduced when free combinations are allowed can be only in a system that includes and effective interactive check of the correctness of more combinations the replacement in natural of by word order has an in a replacement of program tions on labels and goto statements by constructions based on ordering of pro gram structures thus the current interest in program structuring finds some support in the development of natural languages artificial languages let me now turn to another aspect of natural languages and again one which has been taken very by namely artificial languages designed for international communication in this field one finds to the activity of programming ment perhaps the most language is the way in which people get involved in the issues having taken part in some of the work on programming languages i was by the similarity of the problems that se around concerning the choice of an international language as described by in his this is not the place to cover the complete history of artificial languages such a history may be found i will concentrate eg in two ls the first language quality is the conflict and language between support to bring this out consider first the tion as it was around at this time the of an artificial language was fully recognized since when started its and brief ca a whole series of languages had been developed one of them already had organized another one or la developed by the was supported by the pro at the turn of the become a sufficient interested number of in the whole question had to make it possible to an with the task of deciding on the best language this met in paris in including as one of the two in the com decided that although was a strong there were so many details of it that were known to be in need of improvement that it could only be on the condition that it was changed in a number of ways the desirable tions of these changes were already in the language that was first during the conference the significant experience that may be derived from this is the that from the to put it briefly there a the to consider changes to their lan guage many individual changed their support and on and its further improvement declarations and in all directions and thus it that even a language like that was already in when it was but years old to be suited for its de purpose has its support to this years later this is a example of how people tend to shift their support from a higher level of generality in this case an language as such to a lower in this case the particular language that they have for some reason become attached to as a contrast to this ty we may again turn to he first to the discussion of the modified form of then the first world that the work however years later in published a new attack on the pro in the form of a description of a language called he followed this two years later with a complete dictionary of the language and again in when he was years old he published a cal of his own creation a number of modifications the analogy of these with the development of programming languages in recent years seems to me close enough to be of interest the basic seems to be that where the public is con the quality of an language is only at the very early stage of development did fall flat because of technical as soon as the most have been removed the public following of a language depends on the support around the language not on the language itself on this gy corresponds to fortran and cobol if this analogy is valid we should expect fortran and cobol to be with us for many years to come as another conclusion the discussions concerning the best tures to include in a programming language will remain academic perhaps interesting but without deep influence on the main course of events this like a of is there nothing we can do to influence pro gramming at large looking again to the of this we may ask what part of his activity has had the influence this of course cannot be easily or precisely his volume grammar of and other great studies have had influence on but one may is this influence greater than that of his work on the elementary of in he was of a set of that were first published around before the shift from to correctly occurred in count less children have been introduced first to through the display of powerful sentence of these ai in the first ai si m si mi ran it iz fn fan fm for the to the script see the end of the i am to the starting from this work of by analogy this the ce of producing good for the elementary however this should not be since other than the existence of good text have been at work in the of in mark fortran and cobol as given facts of life suppose that the analogy of to and fortran plus cobol is valid in other words that fortran and cobol are here to then it would follow that the attempts better will to replace fail them by something this was recently considered by those who who suggested that fortran would make a better contribution if they would work on improving this language and its use i feel that this point is too strong to be ignored however unlike i dont believe fortran that those people who now and work on other languages have much of it the fortran is that cobol each of the languages algol algol la pl apl etc have their te such an is by its very structure bound to keep the each separate group by definition has as its task to guard that that is in the name of the group as a group the people working with the thing will naturally have the to ve something of the sense of that this the language but it is have a consists of to important value that they contribute to the unique quality of the language for this reason when the members of the for language language q bring out a they will never never of their tell that this has been taken over from good features known for a long time in languages r and t on the contrary they will try to this fact thus they will call them by new names and may well try to modify the features so as to make the influence less obvious this process often will result in an improvement to the worse of the features in question however even if the influence on the languages as such are bound to pat there is another point of influence that of literature this will be red next language and literature the point where the analogy of language and any programming language fails most is that of literature the field of programming just does not have anything that is comparable with the works of while this fact is easy to understand it suggests also that there might be a need for a shift of attention away from programming languages toward the corresponding ture ie toward the programs written in the languages with such a shift the focus of interest becomes algorithmic methods of general interest work in this direction must first of all aim at the writing of programs in order to avoid a ness that might turn the attention away from the proper focus this type of work is at present best done if the algorithms are expressed in at least two different languages at the same time examples of work along this direction are the by d e knuth where the algo are expressed both in an informal programming language based on natural lan guage and in the language mix and the cent by the present writer la where fortran and algol are used side by side when a suitable body of literature has become available study will other forms become of such form is concerned with the style of programs work in this direction has al ready appeared and the interest in programming style is directly analogous with a corresponding interest in natural language style this latter interest reflects the fact that good style is the result of both insight practice and effort that are too often not present in adequate measure by analogy we can expect that good program ming style will remain a combination of sound principles and work and that the against style is never ending and to language the of both and to language as such has until fairly recently been ie the interest has focused on what is as correct good language and on the correct amounts of time and have been spent on trying to stop people from using a to end the sentence with from splitting their etc in the tive has now largely been by a thus based his great grammar and other studies on observations of language as it is and written he that throughout his life he has made separate notes of his observations the is of course well justified case of who are introduced to a new language or are up the native language as children however the makes itself strongly far side the classroom and the and the motivation for this goes far beyond the interest in unambiguous tive conversation one such principle is that earlier forms or meanings of words should a priori be considered more correct than the current ones another of this kind is derived from the use of language for distinguishing classes of people in gives a picture of this class distinction at work in at the turn of the there is little that many of the efforts that derive from an on keeping forms or from the use of language for class distinction have against the change of language in the direction of higher effectiveness for example in written language a distinction between used with and was maintained un the end of the eg i vi we when this distinction was finally removed in the written ge it had been dead in the language for some three years one to think of the that little and in must have in learning this rule it no useful purpose on the contrary getting of the distinction is in some cases a direct help to expres sion in we find close to these states of thus the ing of and programming is we also find a that tions as such and one that par modes of expression for example goto statements on the point of language change has a greater than natural because a change to be really ef has to be implemented in a for this reason the play with language by way of expressions that perhaps start purely as is less active as a source of change instead programming language change goes by way of a series of new lan guages designed as more or less in presenting a new language to the world the designers must assume a de to their creation a has also been taken in a number of studies of eg di no in relation to program literature the has so far been almost completely absent for the good reason that so little literature of systematic study exists the little that has been pu in this direction has dealt with the behaviour of programmers during the program development activity eg b this area of empirical studies of programming might well turn out to gain in in the future conclusion several of the aspects of ma and natural languages show a meaningful analogy with similar aspects of programming languages it therefore makes sense to the analogy to further such aspects on this basis the following conclusions may be drawn the split between the more academic pure science oriented study of program ming languages and the world of practical programming will the of programming language construction is past fortran and cobol will retain their dominance the existing programming languages will develop with only weak interaction among them the areas of influence from studies on at large will be program literature and style the most im of influence being at the fairly elementary level greater interest in empirical studies of programming may be expected to develop in the future to the sentence i can i can run see me run it is fun fun fun in section me see references
