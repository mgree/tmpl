conference record of the fifth annual acm symposium on principles of programming language almost parallel on permit the pennsylvania k state university university park pennsylvania motivation and introduction the or execution computer units of and a processor sort eg several means simultaneous and it may concern different sorts eg or computer units of processors either a the same the computers and scientific processor recently have several arithmetic processors they are designed for computations with a special sort of numeric data structures ie with large matrices arrays their concerns naturally and essentially the definitions of matrix operations according to br the software techniques for exploiting the parallelism of the con of a of an usual serial program there are processors in the which are dependent each on the other because at each instant by each of these pro just one and the same operation may be performed therefore a synchronization of all processors is assumed which is the most difference from the concept of p program scheme of km which allows to about a sequence of particular steps each of which is represented by execution of particular statements in parallel in this paper a p computer with processors is assumed which is also synchronized cu but the processors are fully independent each on the other ie on different processors different operations may be performed at each instant further the con arbitrary simple data and arbitrary opera tions in all generality and not only matrices thus the inherent of any serial pro gram should be discovered and used for up the of computation at most m times while the memory space requirements remain unchanged in cu parallel flow diagrams were and further the following ie a computation of a parallel execution sequence of steps of a serial program was dis in two parts newly permitted state ments are determined by a and then a subset of m or less statements is selected from the set of all permitted and not yet selected statements by a selector the selected statements are executed in parallel on m processors etc until all permitted statements are selected and executed and the computation terminates the and the selector should replace the statement counter of serial programs or flow diagrams by which is determined which statement should be executed as the next one it is whether a suitable hardware tech can be designed to perform as a and selector require the linearity of programs is connected with serial computers having just one processor thus ml essentially and therefore in the following flow diagrams or schemes will be used instead because they allow a natural and parent modification to permit and schemes which represent a new sort of computing not necessarily deterministic algorithms being a generalization of binary trees by which usual arithmetic expres sions are represented it is well known that there is no inherent reason for performing an operation from the of a fraction than an operation from the this of the order an parallelism of any expression which contains which corresponds an nary operation to the fact that with the value of such operation does not depend on the order in which the values of its n arguments were achieved this obvious fact is less clear when algorithms instead of operations are considered permit scheme without computing process branching and a permit scheme without branching is a finite directed graph vm where is the set of its permit edges arrows provided with of vertices and edges such that the following requirements are satisfied i ii iii there exists ar least one initial vertex ie a vertex in which no edge terminates there exists at least one result vertex ie no edge leaves it each vertex and each edge belongs to a simple path from an initial vertex let be the set of all initial result vertices respectively i ii i ii iii pd v set of integers called the permit degree iff is of v and if then res v where is a set of operation symbols provided with an arity of the form fn where nl v inp iff and v iff vv f v fn i ii iii iv set of integers w for each and there exists such that and res there exists exactly one such that further and an interpretation of ps is a mapping int and where is a set of partial operations defined in a set obj such that mt fn is an nary operation let when and be the permit scheme ps interpreted under int a initialization of an interpreted ps is a mapping init v obj where is the algebra in which ps is interpreted one about an initialized ps int a set respect to parallel is said admissible performance if with there does not exist vertices v a vertex and such that and the activity or process in time determined by a permit scheme ps is defined inductively by its computing a vertex finite course vc v is a or infinite sequence of sets of selected vertices which is defined together with sets wi of s as follows vertices and sets i of a is selected i and v such that b i and ii iii i uw where and for each r such that r is selected there such that exists and c if il and mj wj and vj have been defined for j then i vw where n i ii wi df where and for each r there exists and r such that iii vl is selected such that d if there does not exist an integer il such that wi then an integer i must be chosen such that for each ii a vertex course vc v v o v called main if each set vi was selected wi as large as possible ie if wi i i ol s from for if each selected set v of a vertex course vc v v o l v is admissible and if the permit scheme under the consideration ps is interpreted and initialized then the computation is a finite values defined or infinite sequence of sets of assigned to vertices of the form of where which is inductively and uses assigned to of the form as follows a o b i ii ail df for n v where and is such that and r for each rl n c of il defined and j for j il have been then i l ii df v for v where is and such jr the maximal index and r that such for each rl n d if the computation is finite then the values assigned to vertices from after termination are considered as result values and a can be defined as a mapping res v res obj where res is the value after termination otherwise an infinite sequence of values assigned to result vertices is accepted as the result of evaluation of the vertex course vc vi of ps int when initialized by init in fig a permit scheme without branching ps is represented the main course of is finite and its subsets are by dotted lines psi evaluates computes three arithmetic i f i ok v fig e bc fully their and common having in mind the usual arithmetic interpretation and the from v as indicated in fig thus a b cl the computation with the main course is presented in fig when reading properly from up to bottom the assigned values of vertices and edges are actually assigned to them in fig the result values el e and e are obtained as soon as possible because the main course evaluates ps on the basis execute everything that is permitted a vertex of a ps is called if i either ii or and for each r vertex there such exists that exactly one and lemma if each vertex of permit scheme is good and if t is an acyclic relation vi then each vertex is finite each course vi is and when for proof from the and from the and mutual disjointness follows the follows the another permit scheme is represented in fig and is designed in order to characterize mechanism di its main vertex course vc v j period is infinite v but periodic vi for with particular sets v are lines in fig q v inp inp q the the by dotted a fig i yf i i v i fig i using the operation symbols as vertex names in ps one that fl gi and hl are on f y vertices which are not good in ps and further there are three cycles f l g fl f hl in ps thus lemma is not applicable let us consider a such that the following requirement is satisfied i ii all the vertices of fs which are not good belong to the set of the main vertex course of ps if is a vertex which is not respect to r where then there exist no more than two vertices such that and one of them belong to v v mit and the other belongs to a cycle lemma if a permit satisfies selected vertices vi course vc v v o scheme then in is ps each set a vertex admissible of proof if v is a vertex which is not good with respect to r and ww are the corresponding vertices from ii then one immediately that w and w never can belong to the same set of permitted vertices the permit scheme ps in fig satisfies and therefore if interpreted initial the computation is defined which is an infinite sequence all vertex of ps obviously in this case the tion is a mapping res v obj a detailed presentation is in lemmas and some sufficient con were used for the requirement that each set of selected vertices of a vertex course is admissible and therefore computation may be defined a necessary condition for the same purpose is as follows let be the subgraph of such that it contains all vertices and edges which belong to a path v vl vk such that v v and v does o t i not belong to any cycle in vn for k if then v is a good vertex from clear will vertex it is clear that the sufficient condition lemma may be generalized but it is not what a necessary and sufficient condition be for having all selected sets vi of all admissible branching of permit schemes without let us assume a permit scheme such that all sets of vertices vi of any vertex course vi are admissible ps selected v if vi vertex course and we interpreted is another and initialized ps thus also vc and vc then computations init and init will be different if but it can happen that their res and res are the same if this is true for any possible init one writes vc vc int says that and are function equivalent under interpretation int further it can vc int and ps int are function happen vc int equivalent that of any two vertex a permit scheme under int if it is true ps is called deterministic under int theorem the following is good and then interpretation if a permit scheme ps without branching satisfies one of conditions each vertex vv m is acyclic or ps satisfies ps is deterministic under each proof sketch let wi be the main vertex course of ps let us assume that a vertex course vc v v o l vi differs exists from in of d there an integer ij such that o il but by of that there exists a vertex and an index ki because by each vertex must be also selected or later such that but for each hi il ll let us define vi a new vertex course as follows if vc let ii v if for and j ol then v uv i let vi for j kl aid v i v and vj according to the assumption that vc and are vertex of ps and according to it follows that vc is a vertex course of ps too because the vertex v is permitted in wi and therefore can be also selected there thus having in mind vc it is possible main vertex course steps and therefore it is sufficient to such reduction of vc to reduce in this in finite number of it is a base for induction prove that vc to the holds is no finite needed in any interpretation difficulty in the but the additional if vc is infinite int case when condition of ps vc is d there is thus let int be an interpretation and init an initialization of ps then using the assumption that any set of selected vertices of a vertex course is definition of computation may be applied there are two cases if any vertex of ps is good then by c that does not depend on its placing in any set of selected vertices and therefore on any vertex course at all because it depends only on the values of all previous vertices if ps satisfies then the same argument as in is valid for a good vertex v if v is not good then either in vc occurrence k is its and therefore in vc first occurrence vv is the which that because in both the same previous vertices are used in c and if is not the first occurrence in vc then the same is true about vv in vc which follows from the v belongs to a cycle and therefore c must be applied to the same previous vertices a vertex in vi is course vc or the occurrence of v called g with respect to a vertex vi of a permit scheme ps if i either v is an initial vertex of ps ii or and there exists at most one vertex such that where is the maximal and integer r with this property a vertex course vc v v o l v a ps is called gc if each vertex v respect to each vi such that with respect to vc f with is good obviously vertices from vi each set vi of selected a good vertex course vc must be admissible and even more lemma s ps without is deterministic all vertex of good a permit iff ps proof the same sort of used as in the parts and of the proof theorem is of addressing branching and permit diagrams without an addressing of a permit scheme without branching is a new label of its edges u t var where var a set of individual variables or locations addresses registers the addressing a satisfies the following requirements is i ii iii and vw and a iv and vv for any vw sm an addressing of a ps need not exist in fig is a subgraph of a scheme ps such that in of i further by iii and finally by thus which is a contradiction with ii k h fl g fig lemma if each vertex of a permit scheme ps is good then there addressing of ps an addressing a may be defined as follows let a be a mapping and let df av for each lemma if a permit scheme ps satisfies then there exists an addressing of ps an addressing of ps may be defined as follows let a vv be a mapping and let df av for each such that further if vv init and there exists which is not good and such that vw et then there exists vv by such that and one defines vw df and finally if that variable uses iii each vertex is good then and defines init one chooses such a new x and from the proofs of these lemmas the corresponding definitions follow directly in fig an addressing of psi from fig is introduced according to lemma in fig fig is lemma an addressing of introduced in ps from with if a permit scheme is provided with some addressing a n var then var may be understood as a memory unit of a computer the arithmetic unit of which is the algebra in which ps is interpreted and a new labelling of all vertices by usual instructions statements of a lower level pro gramming is defined as follows i ii iii init vv f inp where re w df where where v w and v where for hl n and a lb inp l b b y x lz fig x i y the graph structure is called permit diagram derived from the permit scheme ps provided with addressing a over the following set of instructions input instruction where output instruction assignment where y c var and f xx xn x where fn j ol n and xj for each in fig there is represented diagram derived from fig fig is represented the permit derived from fig the permit and in diagram ab d ab e bc y de p f z z fig m t a m a l yb c fig x d fig if one as follows int f int y in usual int x ab int g y dc int h y and pending permit diagram over an extended set of instructions because constants are allowed also is represented in fig fig permit diagrams with and without branching acyclic permit relation there are two areas of problems which are strongly connected with the concept of permit diagram with acyclic permit relation the first concerns finding an optimal code for an expression where further literature is presented and the second area concern computational complexity of arithmetic expressions mp where further literature is presented in any case the approach here and also in cu cu is more general and not restricted to very special types of arithmetic expressions interpreted in the usual only permit diagrams branching with cycles but without let us consider which ments for an arbitrary are represented in permit diagrams satisfy the following require integer kk and which fig i there are k vertices vi vk such that for il k and each other vertex v satisfies s ii all the vertices l vk and also further vertices wl wk belong to the same cycle in the order vl w thus there exists as follows vk at least one vertex and il w aid on cy between vi for il k iii there exist k disjoint cycles cy each cycle has exactly one vertex vi in common with and at least one vertex more i belongs to in the ordering as vi thus iv all the initial vertices are and for k il k and v all the result vertices are and for il k v v j theorem each vertex course if satisfies vi of then fig is infinite ments i ii iii and satisfies the following require if is the smallest integer such that then there exist in i i i iff k such that for each lj hl k if is and each the set of jl all vertices which belong to cy and are between h and v hl then ij uv ij u uv where ll hl k if w is the set k of all vertices and to from vh then v j j h and are different il uv i jj where u for each hl k proof sketch by one see fig vc to which belong that in the first period all the first occurrences of of vertices are contained all the initial vertices period which are not contained in any other in each period the ordering of vertices v vk n vc is the same as their ordering on which proves i the remaining two assertions ii and iii are immediate consequences of and of the definition of vertex course permit diagrams or schemes satisfying the requirement for an integer k represented in fig describe mechanism as a special sort of theorem in the same way as theorem be proved and in can theorem if satisfies is a deterministic permit diagram then among permit schemes without branching all the vertices are good it is possible to find many other types with periodic vertex which allow higher permit than theorem can be considered as proof of correctness of concurrent process systems presented in ha or ls where petri nets pe bs are used permit diagrams are more powerful tools than petri nets because they allow to several sorts of edges some further possibilities of this sort are discussed in cu permit diagrams with branching in fact all permit edges in permit diagrams or schemes are references are presented concerning where further the data values with which operations should be performed and no ow edges which are only edges occurring in flow diagrams and which are used for the which instruction should be executed as the next one cu from this point of view computation with permit diagrams without branching is fully because there are no flow edges at all in of it is possible to admit a selection of some of instructions without changing the of the permit diagram under the consideration each flow diagram may be easily provided by all its data edges also when the concept of the scope of a defining occurrence of a variable in or input is intro cu au cu cu in such a mixed diagram almost all flow edges may be because not needed for the control but flow edges leaving relation statements where conditions are are labelled by truth be kept for the branching thus these labelled in flow diagrams are used as permit flow edges edges and some sort of with respect to loops ie flow cycles which obviously require some data cycles too a complete of situation these mixed diagrams is not achieved yet in references the design algorithms mass jd unman and analysis of computer
