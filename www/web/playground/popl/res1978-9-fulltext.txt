conference record the annual acm symposium on or programming language automatic discovery of linear of a program cousot and france bp introduction the model of abstract interpretation of programs developed by cousot cousot is applied to the static determination of linear equality or inequality relations among variables of programs for example consider procedure knuth the following p sorting procedure n integer integer bn while b do jl to white do if then no side effects on tj ff b to bt then return i k without user provided inductive assertions nor human interaction we have automatically determined in seconds of cpu time that the following must hold among the variables of the above procedure bn jl to bn bn to jl bn jl to bn j to to t t bn bl de au n de this work was supported by under grant a certain number of classical data flow analysis techniques are included in or generalized by the determination of linear equality relations among program variables for example constant propagation can be understood as the discovery of very simple linear equality relations among variables such as x y however the resolution of the more general problem of determining linear equality relations among variables allows the discovery of symbolic constants such as xn the same way common subexpressions can be recognized which are not formally identical but are equivalent because of the relationships among variables also the loop invariant computations as well as loop induction variables modified inside the loop by the same loop invariant can be determined on a basis which is not purely the problem of discovering linear equality relations is in fact a particular case of the one of discovering linear inequality relations among the program variables the main use of these inequality relationships is to determine at compile time whether the value of an expression is within a specified numeric or symbolic of the integers or reals this includes compile time overflow integer and array bound checking in contrast to we do not simply try to verify the assertions such as verifying that array subscripts are within the declared range but we try to discover the assertions of linear type that can be from the semantics of the program the advantage is that we can often discover relations which are never stated explicitly in the program for example we can discover that an integer variable lies in a of its declared range or that two references and aj to two elements of the same array refer to different storage locations since dead eg ji or that some piece of code is the problem of determining equality relation between a linear combination of the variables of the program and a constant was solved by his approach was based on algorithm which requires that the properties to be discovered form a lattice every strictly increasing chain of which is of finite length this is not valid when considering inequality relation because of chains such as x the model of cousot is general enough to with this problem and we briefly recall it in section as formulated in cousot in we study formal representations for the particular type of assertions that we consider in section we describe the linear transformer pending to elementary instructions of the language the algorithm performing the global analysis of programs is presented in section by means of simple examples section gives more examples and section discusses the experimental implementation that has been realized of for purposes of a sequential program will be represented by a connected finite flowchart with one entry node and assignment test and exit nodes the evaluations of the righthand side of an assignment and of the boolean expression in a test node are assumed not to affect the values of any variables thus all sideeffect must be modeled as assignment statements the nodes contain no computations and represent the merge of program execution paths the analysis of a program consists in an assertion pi vi v to each arc i of the program these on the variables vi vn are not necessarily of the most general form but instead are designed to model a specific aspect of the semantic properties of the program the assertion on the entry arc to the program represents what is known about the variables at the start of execution for each other type of program node a transformation specifies the assertion associated with the output arcs of the node in terms of the assertions on the input arcs to the node and where relevant the content of the node hence we have established a system of equations between the local assertions which can be solved by successive approximations cousot starting from no information on each arc this resolution consists in propagating the entry assertion around the program graph by application of the tion described for each type of node until all possible paths are followed with synchronization on nodes it is assumed that each cycle in the program graph contains a marked node which is called a loop node in order to ensure the transformation for a loop node will be an approximation of the transformation for ordinary nodes more precisely let p be the assertions j associated with the input arcs of a node at step j let qi be the assertion associated with the output arc of this node a loop then qj fp j node we have p for qj q vj where the operation v performed at step j is such that q and q and for any chain po pi p the chain is not an strictly increasing chain in the examples we shall use the algorithm described above and in more detail cousot infinite in linear among variables of a program linear system of a convex polyhedron xn be the variables of for simplicity we assume that the values variables belong to the set i of reals solutions to a system of linear equations the program of the the set of where a bj if such solutions exist is a linear of in a linear variety of dimension n is an the set of solutions to a linear inequality xl is a of rn for strict inequalities are not considered by linear we mean either a linear or a linear inequality in the formal reasoning we often consider that an equation can be viewed as two opposite inequalities a subset c of r is said to be convex only if xc va if and c for example linear and are convex the intersection of two convex sets is convex but the union of two convex sets is not necessarily convex the set of solutions to a finite system of line inequalities can be interpreted as the closed convex polyhedron of if defined by the intersection of the closed corresponding to each inequality the frame of a convex polyhedron let vl vp be vectors in in a vector of the form v q is where a for each il p we have of the v tie set of all linear combinations of the v linear generated by the v a basis of a linear variety l is a minimal vectors generating l a vector of the form we have uc pcf positive of the vi positive combinations of the vi of the v a of the form where for each u is called a the set of all is the where for each we have m with convex of the vi is called of all convex combinations of the v of the v i is the convex hull a of a polyhedron p is a point x of p which is not a convex combination of other points a of p and p and ai and implies p or a of a polyhedron p is a vector r such that there exists an to r and entirely included in p two r and r are equal if and only if ue a of a polyhedron p is called an if and only if it is a positive combination of other rl of p vj q u or rr extreme of a translated to intuitively is a point a vertex a that both of a polyhedron d and d are a polyhedron p is a vector d such of p which contains at least one line is called a the linear variety generated greatest by all the lines of a is the linear variety included in the a polyhedron that contains no line has only a finite number of vertices and of extreme a bounded has neither lines nor each point of a bounded polyhedron is a convex com of the vertices of the polyhedron so that a bounded vertices polyhedron is the of its each point x of a polyhedron can be expressed as combination of the vertices of a positive combination of r rp p which is not a the sum of a convex sl so the extreme la lll let l be the greatest linear variety included in a p let l be a linear variety orthogonal to l then the intersection of l with p is a convex polyhedron which contains no line and which is called a section of p each point of a can be expressed as the sum of a convex combination of the vertices of a section of p a positive combination of the extreme of this section and a linear combination of the vectors of a basis of the greatest linear variety included in p by of words the vertices and of a will be the vertices and of a section of that a closed convex polyhedron p can be characterized by three sets s sl so r rl ro dd vectors of r called the of the polyhedron as follows ol ill v z ail and x xq we have two equivalent representations of a closed convex polyhedron either as the set of tions of its system of linear or as the convex hull of its frame the polyhedron defined by the following system of x xx x x is the diagram vertices extreme no line o x by the following r frame see end of example fi o x before looking at the problem of conversion these representations we need some definitions a of a polyhedron such that if a point p is a convex polyhedron x lies in f then each segment included in p and containing x is included in f and and the of a polyhedron p is the dimension of the least linear variety containing p a face of dimension k is called a an edge is a the vertices of a polyhedron containing no line a has no let s b be a linear inequality defining intersection of the x the polyhedron p defined then if the by h with p is not empty it is a face of p we say that a point s the inequality zl we say that s bi if the and only if r xq bi this inequality if and only if let be the dimension of the greatest linear variety included in the polyhedron p two vertices are said to be iff they lie on the same edge ie if o we mean the edge of the section it follows that the number of inequalities saturated at the same time by two adjacent vertices is at least n two extreme are said to be iff they belong to the same face therefore they at least n inequalities simultaneously finally a vertex s and a r are adjacent iff s lies on an infinite edge which is parallel to r therefore s must all the inequalities by r conversions between the representations of a polyhedron by a system of linear and by a frame some operations that we have to perform on closed convex polyhedra are easy when these polyhedra are represented by systems of linear while others are more simple when the frame representation is used hence we must be able to make conversions from one representation to the other conversion from the frame to the linear representation this conversion consists in finding a system of for the of the elements points lines of a frame this conversion is followed by a simplification of the system of of a finite frame let ss rp d be the frame of a nonempty polyhedron so that the points x of this polyhedron are characterized the existence kd pl po vl so by v i such that for il o for jl p p u r jl j j hence this polyhedron of linear is characterized in upon by a system the variables n o vj jl d dl eliminating the we get a system of linear in this elimination can always be done by the projection operation used in let us represent the system of where a is a real matrix in order to eliminate the variable m inequalities and b a xc we project by according a simplified to the column c upon in order to get system defined as follows for each row a such ao the is part of the system for each two rows a and az such that al lab is part of the system the column system contains only it is independent of xc in the example eliminating x in the system end of the of the by successive approximations frame s r o is computed pl p pop as follows pl is the point sl so that the corresponding system of is x then for each i pi is the si if and of only p and the ­ if point if is the system of is equivalent describing to p it can be shown that and this then by a projection k can be eliminated of pi according to the column of to get a system of for each joining the op r to j u p j pl is obtained jl to this consists in eliminating v b j is for each pk is built by in uo from by of the line d if k s described by this consists in eliminating v in b finally of s r and o p is the op the frame of a polyhedron in given by il r ic the first approximation psi is defined by the system second of approximation xi xo p is the the of pi and s that is xx eliminating a we get x xx p is obtained by the to p that is uo xx eliminating p we get xx is the the last approximation of p and the line pq that is eliminating v we get the final solution x end of example simplification inequalities of a system of linear it is often the case that projections lead to systems of containing a great number of irrelevant which can be without changing the polyhedron represented by the system of for the sake of efficiency these irrelevant must be ex knowing a frame of the polyhedron the corresponding system of linear inequalities can be simplified according to the following remarks due to an inequality which is never saturated by a vertex of the frame is irrelevant an inequality which is saturated by all vertices and all of the frame represents an equality all the equalities are found in that way let cl and c be two of the system of which not equations let g be the defined by are and hence means that or c is saturated cl if by any vertex but not cl is irrelevant if and then one and only one of the that one of them can be applying these results to a system a minimal system of irrelevant inequality corresponding polyhedron is irrelevant so of with no to the same we conversion from the linear to the frame representation of the polyhedron based on the pivot method of linear programming numerous algorithms have been designed to find all vertices of a convex polyhedron we shall give a brief tion of method which is general enough to find a frame vertices extreme lines of a convex polyhedron we first recall some elements of linear programming basic concepts of linear programming a system of linear inequalities can be written in the equivalent form bj yj jl ml hence a system of can standard form xe where a is a real matrix nm f n be written in b is an the variables xi are the initial the xi ie are the variables a basis of the system is a non a of a i the system can be written form with respect to the basis ay l xe where in jl nm are said to be if and only if the variables in basis the two xl such that cl basis a is feasible feasible bases ai and aj are said to be if and only if the of the set inj is equal bases are adjacent the classical transforms the system written in respect to at into an equivalent to ml if two pivot operation canonical form with system in cal form with respect to a the j basis method which is the initialization step of the method transforms the system of into an equivalent system in canonical form with respect to a feasible basis of whenever such a basis exists principles of method the graph of the relation ai of feasible bases containing all on the set initial variables ie such that is connected hence given such a basis we can by successive operations and an exhaustive traversal technique find all feasible basis of a given system of res if at is a feasible basis such that then the f corresponds to a vertex of the convex polyhedron defined by the system of to each vertex of a polyhedron containing no line corresponds at least one feasible basis if two vertices are adjacent then there are two adjacent feasible bases respectively corresponding to them let xe be the canonical form of with respect to the feasible containing all initial variables then shows that condition if a column i ce o satisfies of a basis a i the then the vector defined by k where is an result and j is o extreme the of to each column unique index the polyhedron i verifying a applying this in each feasible basis corresponding to a vertex s we find all extreme adjacent to s since each extreme of a polyhedron that contains no line is cent to a vertex we can find all extreme of such a polyhedron for polyhedra containing a line there is no feasible bases containing all initial variables hence let be the canonical respect to any feasible basis a i let a column satisfying the condition form with be let the vector of a zo ao or the ith component of which is defined by then then where j is the unique index such else o fi then shows that that aq o corresponds to a line of the polyhedron if the basis ai is such that each io fl verifies the property is a basis then the set of the greatest linear variety contained in the polyhedron algorithm for finding polyhedron the frame of a convex let be a system of m linear among the variables build the standard form xe where apply the first step of the method if there is no feasible bases the polyhedron is empty otherwise we get the system xe in canonical form with respect to the feasible basis a with while there exists an initial variable out of the basis and satisfying per form a which puts this variable in the basis by removing a variable from the basis we get a system xe in canonical form with the basis two must be considered if all initial variables are in the basis fc then the polyhedron contains no line and a vertex has been found then traverse all feasible bases of the sys tem and note at each step the vertex and the that are found an efficient algo rithm for this is given by the initial remaining variables out of so xl x the basis verify did is a basis of the greatest linear contained in the polyhedron system of variety the following d defines a new polyhedron p which is a section of the initial polyhedron applying the algorithm to this new system of case is applicable since p contains no lines so that the algorithm terminates let us compute a frame of the polyhedron corresponding to the following system of s xl l xx s p the matrix notations for denoting systems of equations the standard form of s is x x x x x x x i so the system s to the infeasible is in canonical basis a form with respect the sin artificial canonical basis method the system form with respect to the basis m then variables we put into the basis as we can we get as many the basis initial a sm the initial variable and cannot be put into x remains out of the basis the basis getting x out the third column verifies j the vector is the only line of the p let us build the system of a section p of p hence poly of s s o xl ­ s o xx xx applying and to form with respect to the which contains all initial s we get the canonical feasible basis a variables thus we have found a first vertex of the graph of p and we start of vertices the x x x x x x x v v o s lo basis a vertex column s satisfies adjacent feasible basis a xl x x x x x x i o o s o vertex sl no column satisfies adjacent feasible and a bases a already found o s o l basis vertex a s column satisfies adjacent feasible basis a already found all feasible bases that contain have been found the algorithm following frame for p s lll r o end of initial terminates variables with the simplification of a frame proposes a method for eliminating all irrelevant members of a frame when a system of of the polyhedron is known this method is the dual of the one given at for simplifying a system of inequalities method is based on the following results a vertex or a no inequality is irrelevant a all corresponds to a line if e and e are two vertices or two which are not lines in the frame the g is defined by every inequality by el is by ez then and that el is irrelevant and imply that one but only one of the two elements may be eliminated on the use of two representations assertions for the search for the frame of a polyhedron as described above may become very expensive although many important optimization are possible the number of vertices of a polyhedron generated in in by m inequalities is known to be bounded only by functions increasing very quickly with m and n so the use of this method should be avoided except when applied to polyhedra which are thought to have very few vertices however the use of two representations is necessary for the following reasons some operations like the of two poly can only be performed on the frame representation others like widening require the representation in order to define the inclusion relation between two polyhedra it is very useful to know both representations indeed if and only if each element of the frame of pi the of p it appears representation that it is difficult without knowing to one the other one and neither can be used efficiently without tions so we shall build at the same time and in a consistent way the systems of and the frames of the polyhedra both representations will be simultaneously used to represent the assertions experience shows that this redundant representation is much less expensive than the use of conversions assignment let be the representation input assertion p corresponding to the the frame of which is il of the polyhedron d rr jl j assignment assign p p od kl of the output assertion x is given by lo x then the rep p after the assignment of a non linear expression if the expression that any value ex is not linear of be assigned it is as to x hence after the assignment x ex nothing is known about the value lo of x therefore x is eliminated from the system of by a projection along the column for the frame representation this consists in adding the line d such that different from l d and o to the set of for every lines o jn then in general the representation of p is not minimal and must be simplified and example let n and p be the input by the system of assertion rep linear assertions by elementary given the flowchart representation of programs we now give for each type of program node a trans formation specifying the assertion associated with the output of the node in terms of the as associated with the input arcs of the node and where relevant the content of this node the conditions of cousot the correctness of these transformations apply to the specific case analyzed here program entry node in some cases parameters of procedures the re on the input variables may be known in this case they constitute the assertion associated with the input arc otherwise the variables are assumed not to be initialized so that they satisfy no hence the vector their values may be any point of n where n is the number of variables involved in the program analysis the corresponding polyhedron is given by a system with no and equivalently by the frame con in the vertex which is the origin of no the lines all dn such that for every dl and and xx the frame r do ation is is s the interpret ol e xl the output x s simplifying assertion is p after the assignment x the frame of which is we that get is s l r xl o the approximation is obviously substitution of for x constraints would lead to very in the input since system the of x s xx i however and this x xl x xx the corresponding situation is domain is not a polyhedron x also is equivalent to ma which leads to the output system of satisfied by x assignments f then we cannot solve x in terms of x so that some information is lost by the assignment hence is eliminated from the input by a projection operation the case is similar to the one of the assignment of a nonlinear ex except that the x ab is to the resulting system example let p be the input assertion defined by note however that the exact domain is covered by the approximate domain cousot also a more precise analysis is feasible for example and implies or the assign x y equal to zero end of implies that x is greater than or assignment of a linear expression the assignment is of the form x where b is a is a an integer or in an vector a real of of integers or reals and the transformation con the basis of the space the output assertion p is defined by the frame sr computed as follows ss and i s where s is defined by s where ll with rr where rj is the vector defined w r and dd d by d rl r for n and jj where d is k the vector defined and dd for n and the system of corresponding obtained as the of the however following this can be computed directly to p can frame system of re be invertible assignments the assignment is of the form x a o the fact that allows us to carry over our knowledge of the previous value of x to new value of x to see this denote the values of the variables by x before and by x after the invertible assignment statement then for n and zo we have x lx whereas x there x as defined by xx for i o the assignment elimination of leads to x is x is not invertible x in the input system of so that the output system x the of re x x xx x the assignment x and x xx input system of we is invertible substituting get the output so that in the system end of example test nodes let be the assertion associated with the input arc to a decision node testing boolean condition c let some and be the assertions associated respectively with the true and false exits of the test obviously ptp and c and am the condition c is said to be linear if and only it is of the form or where a is an of integers or reals x is the of program variables and b is an integer or a real if nonlinear tests if c is not a linear condition we ignore the test by putting pt pf p this is certainly valid but it may not be as much information as could be as for non linear assignments specific studies can be made of how best to handle test conditions which are not linear for example implies linear equality tests when c is a linear condition let h be the if c is of the form then either p is included in h in which case pt p and pf or p is not in h in case and note that and is approximated by since the domain and is not in general a closed convex polyhedron the frame of is found thanks to the fol results each vertex s of lies on an edge of p according to one of the following alternatives s is a vertex of p that belongs to h there are two adjacent vertices s and s of p such that where there are a vertex belongs to s and a rl of p such that sl is adjacent to r in p and where is positive there are a vertex sl and a line dl of p such that where each extreme r of is either an extreme of p that belongs to h or a positive combination of two adjacent extreme rl and r of p where must be positive or the sum of an extreme r of p and a vector linearly of a line dl of p that is finally a vector d is a line of if and only if there are two lines dl and dz in p such that linear inequality tests if c is of the form then ptp whereas p p and f is not strict since p must f and that we can write as above the determination that the inequality be a closed polyhedron for integers of the frames of pt and pf makes use of a frame of the inter section of p with the the set st of vertices of pt is ss if st is empty then pt is the empty polyhedron whereas the set p equals f p otherwise st is not empty rt of extreme of pt is and u u u r the set of lines ot of pt is o a symmetric reasoning is used to determine frames a frame of p f and the resulting are not necessarily minimal and must be simplified l let p be an input x assertion defined by ss sz r let pt and pf be the output the true xx assertions and false that is associated respectively with exits of a test on the condition where a b and x is the xx let h be the defined by the equation the interpretation is the following at pf in order to to know p determine a frame of it is the adjacent elements of the frame of are cent the vertex that s of h corresponds to the case is s s the extreme r of corresponds that is r to case a frame of pt is given by a frame of pf is given by end of simple nodes simple the merge of the statement nodes correspond then and else more generally for paths let example to in a con pl pc pp be the assertions associated with the input arcs to the simple node and p the output as pi p p p then the output y p assertion p i does not to a convex polyhedron must be approximated by the pp which is the least polyhedron so that it p of pl containing pl p p since the can assume without lost are two input arcs p operation is associative of generality that there given we and p the frame of is and the system of describing p is the of the frame which can be computed by successive as soon as the system of re of p is known the frame of p can be simplified that cannot be com directly from the systems of and in order to avoid a conversion the redundant frame tation has been kept along with the representation for the output assertion p the conversion from frame to representation is expensive since the system of of pi or p is known this conversion is optimized as follows u ­ convex ­ so that starting incorporate in frame of pz from the we can the elements of the example s s ri zf the vertex of pl given of by and the by elimination of in eliminating a in x we get the approximation x given by the of p in by elimination of u in p that is p we get the convex hull of pl and pz given end of by x xx loop nodes each cycle in the program node graph contains pi q p p a loop y p the corresponding p transformation lp pd is defined by the widening operation v let and be two convex polyhedra then qi v qz is the convex polyhedron linear of qi verified of the frame of qz consisting by every in the element ze ql s q s x end of example j ro do ro in order to compute the frame of it is necessary to convert from the linear rep method is known to be expensive however when applied after a widening operation the cost remains reasonable because of the following arguments in the widening of q by q a certain num of vertices of q have been replaced by extreme hence the widening operation eliminates vertices so that can be assumed to have a small number of vertices now it is the discovery of vertices which is the most costly in method a frame of q is known and q is included in method therefore needs not of the initialization of the to be used moreover since is a of qi it is any re highly numerous that the frames common elements of qi and have the correctness called at criterion of cousot re is satisfied since and for every chain g cn g the chain not an infinite strictly increasing chain since each step n the number of describing is finite and less than or equal to the number of describing is at s n the definition of the widening operation must be a balance between the convergence of the global analysis of the program by away the that do not quickly in the pro gram cycles and discovering as much information as possible about the program hence it is not to perform widening operations at loop nodes before the information along the program cycles containing that loop node also the definition of the widening which we have given is a one the that have been carried out seems to our choice but further studies are necessary to give a definite conclusion global analysis of programs we illustrate the following simple enough the global adhoc to allow hand analysis of programs program which is computations on po pi p p p p p p l then else f go to l the test involving some nonlinear condition is not taken into account each assertion p io is initially the empty polyhedron and the input assertion is propagated through the program graph z o s ro f s ro p p p pl pi assign pi ij ro do p p s p ro s ro j j p o l i

only constraint of p not verified by every element of the frame eliminated by the widening of operation pl is j t pl o i p sj pp p s r p s p r j s l i p p i then the program analysis is included has in p so that the final result shows up linear the variables of the program that never appear in the program text and often escape notice of studying this simple example among o no information j example on the next example it is not possible to trace the details of the analysis so that we directly provide the results produced by our experimental implementation lo y procedure n real n t begin

statically that all array accesses are correct notice that some relation among the variables of the procedure are not obvious and cannot be discovered by hand deep understanding of the program notes on the experimental implementation we have produced an experimental implementation written in pascal on the computer the length of the program is about lines the systems of equations and have been represented for simplicity by real matrices and this sometimes results in a loss of precision it seems very difficult to write the program so that this loss of precision is acceptable that is so that the relationships which have been found to a domain including any value that each real variable can take during any execution of the analyzed program however the main applications we have in mind such as array bound checking deal with integer variables in this case the of the linear are which can be represented as pq where p and q are integers then the operations which are performed on these coefficients xl are more costly but introduce no loss of precision we have that programs involving numerical constants are better handled when these numerical constants are replaced by the declaration of a sym constant it is often the case that the convergence of the analysis is faster the systems of are it seems to be very difficult to evaluate the cost of the analysis of a program the cost of the analysis does not only depend on the length number of lines of the program but mainly on the com of the program graph number of loops degree of loop combination the cost of an analysis etc it seems that almost linear in the length of the program but exponential in the number of variables involved in the analysis from this point of view nested static such as algol blocks which very local declarations or better with its import mechanism is useful since for example of an outer block can often be analyzed independently of the variables of the inner blocks whereas the vari be inner block can often be analyzed using only few global variables in general it can be taken advantage of the scope rules of the usual languages we have taken to take account of the the point of view not which must hold on the variables fr example if a pro gram variable is used as an array index which do not take of the fact that we should try to show that the value of this variable must be within the array bounds could propagate loop line for the us to combine taking account of such facts we this information backward to the nodes so that we would have a guide widening operation this would enable the
